# TrajectoryTutorial v2.0

After plenty of requests from comments of [the original tutorial](https://vilbeyli.github.io/Simple-Trajectory-Motion-Example-Unity3D/) on how to make launching work for arbitrary heights,
I've decided to rewrite the tutorial and make it a 2-part series with this v2.0. 

Part-I will be published sometime soon, Part-II sometime later and the links below will be updated accordingly.
